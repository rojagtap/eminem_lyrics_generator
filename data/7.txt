Daddy what are you doing?
Okay then!
Everybody listen up!
I'm goin' to hell!
Who's comin' with me?
Somebody please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you,
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls, I cut'em off
And got'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off (Suck it, Marshall)
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby
My Dad's Lost It!
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy
It's like my mother always told me and codeine and
Goddammit you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Uh, fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick and lick
A million mutherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a mutherfuckin' Gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo. Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?
Dad
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise at the same time
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids love it
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy
Crazy
Ha ha ha
You're funny daddy!
